"""Lead qualification.

`RuleQualifier` is the zero-dependency default (and a strong baseline). The
fine-tuned LoRA classifier in `speed_to_lead.ml` implements the same
`Qualifier` protocol and is dropped in when its adapter is present — so the
graph never knows or cares which one is running. Both funnel through
`assemble_result`, so a rule decision and a model decision have the exact same
shape; only the source of the *intent* and *confidence* differs.
